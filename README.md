# Neural-Networks
## Summary Challenge 19 
- We have a dataset for Alphabet Soup that is a organization that over the years has funded more than 34000 organizations.  The client would like to know what projects are likely to be successful to receive future funding.
- We build a machine learning model, in this case we used Deep Learning Neural Network model to fit the data.
- We preprocess all numerical and categorical variables, then appy the StandarScaler class.
- Finally we train and fit the model, and evaluate the model using the test data.
- We print the loss and accurary of the test data evaluation.
